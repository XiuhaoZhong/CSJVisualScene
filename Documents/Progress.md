# CSJVisualScene Progress 

### 2025-04-17
#### Current progress
1. Render objects management, load the render information(mesh, material etc.) from game objects
2. Render resources management, load the render objects which are in the current scene, and upload their render information to the render context.

### 2025-06-24
1. Run this application on my new computer.
2. Should improve the vscode config like the CSJMediaParser.
3. Need to adjust the architecture, for the modules are often changed(feature modules), using dynamic libraries, and others should be linked as static library(log module)
